# Comparative-study-on-Particle-Swarm-Optimization-and-Genetic-Algorithm
Researchers are paying a lot of attention to evolutionary algorithms as viable solutions to various  efficient operation issues. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is widely used in many domains due to  its logic, ease of use, and capacity to resolve difficult issues frequently encountered in  engineering systems.
 The GA's disadvantage is that it has a high implementation cost and 
typically calls for more iteration. A relatively new predictive technique called Particle Swarm 
Optimization (PSO) is based on the swarming behavior of real things. PSO and the GA are both 
evolutionary search methods, meaning that they switch from one set of points to another inside 
iteration while clearly improving upon the prior values making use of a combination of 
probabilistic and deterministic principles. The implementation, characteristics, and efficacy of 
these two evolutionary algorithms are examined in this research.
